I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?

I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money."

The restaurant is owned by the same family that owns South 21 curb service on Independence Blvd, which has been there since you could cross Independence blvd at numerous intersections, even on foot (way long y'all).\\n\\nThat being said, its quality junk-food at its best.  Its by no means healthy, but its a lot better than any fast food you could put in your body.  The tartar sauce is famous and for good reason...its the best I've ever had and cannot be replicated (the recipe is super secret).  They have two types of cole slaw, either mayo or vinegar based, both of which are delish.\\n\\nI like to go during the week to beat the crowds, as on the weekend it is out of control (you can tell by the size of their parking lot).",

         "It's normal to travel 370 miles specifically for a restaurant, right? As soon as my boyfriend and I booked our flights to Montreal I reserved Friday dinner here. Three weeks away, and all I could get were two seats at the bar! This wound up being better in the end. Joe Beef's menu is ever-changing, written on a chalkboard on the wall (in French). The friendly bartender read us the entire menu, sharing recommendations as he went.  We ordered:\\n\\nThe freshest oysters I have ever tasted\\nTwo appetizers - the famous foie gras double down (half order), a menu staple consisting of two fried pieces of foie gras with bacon and maple syrup sandwiched between; and a shredded turkey leg concoction that was reshaped around a bone to look like a drumstick.I could have stopped here and been satisfied. The foie gras was out of this world. Life changing. I am so lucky that I do not live in Montreal, I would turn into a foie gras double down\\n\\nFor entrees, I had veal scaloppini and Jamie had the half hen. Both came with generous sides of rice, mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. The veal was a bit salty, but everything else was perfect.\\n\\nThe courses were well-paced, and the bartender informed us that the restaurant allots at least three hours for each reservation. A refreshing and leisurely experience for us New Yorkers! Three hours later, the friendly barkeep gave us some maple sorbet to finish, and we were on our way, full and happy.",

         "We went on Saturday night to satiate my craving for good karaoke. \\n\\nFor food I ordered the \\\"TV dinner\\\" which is a huge metal tray of two entrees and three sides. I tried the pulled pork, half rack of ribs, cornbread, mashed potatoes, rice, and veggie of the day. The ribs were falling off the bone and tender, but could have used extra sauce. The pulled pork was dry and really needed extra sauce, and the texture seemed off. The sides were all pretty much awful. You could tell they make a big batch in the morning and it sits there all day. In addition they were all vastly underseasoned. My husband had the black and blue burger, which strangely enough he said was OVERseasoned. So the food was pretty much disappointing, but you do get a lot for the price, and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since they stop serving food at 11pm and we came at about 10:40. Next time we will try eating there earlier. \\n\\nThe service was fine; the waitress checked on us frequently and promptly. They do have a good beer list and the beer prices are okay, although the mixed drink prices are a teensy bit high for my tastes (although probably comparatively low for some South Side venues). The restrooms were cleaned and fully stocked, which is a plus for such a busy bar. Speaking of busy, the place was packed when we came, and they do boast an awesome patio that probably more than doubles their seating capacity.\\n\\nThe karaoke was AWESOME. It really saved this place from getting a two star review. They had a great, lively crowd doing some really zany and entertaining performances. The host has the best karaoke setup I've seen: live video background of you singing, playback clips of your performance, and a VERY up to date computerized catalog. If anything, I'll be back for his karaoke! We'll give the food a second shot another day.",

         "My husband and I were headed to Mellow Mushroom when we saw the sign for Selwyn Ave Pub - a big Shamrock, all Green and Irish Specials lured us in believing we were about to eat some Irish food.. We were so dead wrong, there wasn't a single irish related thing on the menu. The server was friendly and greeted us right away, My husband asked for coffee and the server told him \\\"There isn't any brewed, so.. anything else I can get you?\\\" ... So they HAVE coffee..but he didn't feel like making it? COOL. We should have left right then and there.. I guess the server kind of realized his error, and then tried to back pedal and excuse that the coffee takes \\\" a while \\\" to brew. My husband and I have been in the service industry before and I recognize laziness when I see it. If you don't have coffee brewed, you alert the customer of how much time it will take to brew - then let them decide if they still want it. \\n( The food \\\" takes a while \\\" to cook also.. WE STILL WANT TO EAT, THOUGH! )  \\nBut instead of making things complicated - My husband told him he would just take sweet tea instead and we just moved forward with trying to find out which meals we wanted. When we inquired about why there was no Irish food; the server told us it was because \\\"The regular customers would get sick of eating Irish food\\\" .... WHAAAAT? an Irish pub that doesn't serve anything Irish? This business is decorated in and advertising IRISH everything.. and it has a hanging sign that says IRISH SPECIALS. We were informed the irish specials are only during St. Patricks day.. So I guess that hanging sign is just left over from then = Example of More laziness and 2nd opportunity we should have just left.. but No.. we were running out of time, and we were hungry.. so we each ordered food the server recommended and it came out quick and hot. Thats cause it was all frozen and deep fried. Yaaay.. ( -_- ) I'm sure Selwyn Avenue Pub is a decent BAR... but don't go there hoping for anything special to EAT. Their outside seating looks inviting and the service was fast, just a little uneducated about their menu and less than eager to make you a pot of coffee.",
